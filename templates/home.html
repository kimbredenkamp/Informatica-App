        <h2>Let's Talk Dirty</h2>
        <p>To produce mushrooms special compost is used that consists of a mixture of, among other things, horse manure, chicken manure, straw and plaster. Before the compost is suitable for use it undergoes various treatments. The preparation process of the compost is aimed at providing an optimal breeding ground (including sugars) to obtain mushroom cultivation and to prevent unwanted growth prevent microorganisms.</p><br>
        <h2>Enriching the Soil Naturally</h2>
        <p>However, a major problem in mushroom cultivation is the large variation of each harvest. This can partly depend on the management at the various growing companies and this is partly dependent of the quality of the compost. In addition, despite many precautions, the fungus Trichoderma aggressivum regularly the compost for. This fungus can in a short time the bed in which the mushrooms are grown overgrowth, making the harvest unsuccessful. Also microorganisms that survived the pasteurization process in the compost can have a negative or a positive influence on the cultivation. These microorganisms form a microflora in the compost. The microflora in the compost will constantly change during the process composition and play a major role in the degradation of the compost (fermentation) and the construction of a structure suitable for the mushroom and nutrients. In addition, the microflora plays a positive or negative role towards pathogenic microorganisms. Because of the lack of methods to detect microorganisms present in the compost, characterize and quantify, there is currently little insight in the presence and composition of microflora in the differentÂ phases of the process and the associated influence that the microflora has on crop results.</p>
